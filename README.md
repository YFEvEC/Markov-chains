# Markov Chains Project

This GitHub repository contains a project exploring Markov chains conducted by Eve Chen. The project investigates a game related to Markov chains, where a player rolls a six-sided fair die in each turn and makes score calculations based on specific rules. The primary goal is to model this game as a Markov chain and analyze various aspects, including the expected number of rolls until the game ends and the distribution of the number of rolls.

## Project Highlights

- **Game Simulation:** The project simulates a game where the player accumulates scores by rolling a die and applies rules to reach a goal score.

- **Markov Chain Construction:** It constructs a Markov chain representation of the game, defining states, transition probabilities, and the absorbing state.

- **Expected Value Calculation:** The project calculates the expected number of rolls required to end the game by solving for the canonical form of the transition matrix.

- **Distribution Analysis:** It analyzes the distribution of the number of rolls until the game ends and identifies key statistics such as the median and maximum probabilities.

- **Goal Score Relationship:** The project investigates the relationship between the expected number of rolls and the chosen goal score, providing insights into how increasing the goal score impacts the game.

- **Fitting a Function:** It explores a fitting function to predict the expected number of rolls based on the goal score and provides upper and lower bounds for the fit.
